# Rule
- With my accomplishments, I will be very detailed. I probably should decide to describe my accomplishments using the STAR method.
- I could also tailor this to describe workplace situations that I ran into while I was here too. I can train myself to become more of a storyteller.

## Projects

- Enable multiple-file upload feature onto RShiny app
- Bayesian inference model development. Added model validation pipeline for posterior distributions by using RHat and ESS to check for proper convergence.
- Write SQL queries to pull more dose-response datasets to run against Bayesian inference
- Build command-line interface to run model inference for a protocol along a specified time period
- Build Spotfire interface to ingest Bayesian inference output
- Bayes model proof-of-concept: Compare potency between two chemically similar molecules
- Lead team to participate in internal Kaggle competition towards outlier detection
- Build Spotfire app to parse machine readings from [blank] instruments and perform curve-fitting in inactivation kinetics 
- In 3-biomarker high-content aggregation app, I added option to manually set intensity threshold, and custom naming of plates in Spotfire



- Building high content image feature extraction pipeline
- Supporting model development for outlier detection on dose-response data
- Curate and perform numerous analyses on High-throughput screen (HTS) datasets by writing SQL queries
- Enabled Bayesian model pipeline by automating data collection, triaging, feature engineering, and model evaluation, along with packaging into a command-line interface
- Enabled calculation and analysis of high-content fluorescence plates using Spotfire
- Spearheaded experimentation with software infrastructure to unify/automate team's development and production workflow
- Took end-to-end ownership of a project to quantify variability in dose-response data
- Developed interactive front-end for data exploration of model results using Spotfire
- Built 2 data-analysis web applications for scientists using Flask
- Conceieve of models to add uncertainty to parameters, namely Hierarchal Bayesian methods
- Developed SQL query to calculate Minimum Signficant Ratio (MSR) on all lead profiling panels in BMS

## Workplace situations
### Dealing with multiple projects
- Currently dealing with multiple projects where i have major involvement, as follows
    - Outlier detection
    - Hit deconvolution (Image analysis)
    - Calculate MSR score on everything
    - Collaboration for Bayesian inference
- Approaching it by keeping track of priorities for each project (making an effort to consult with my boss and project leaders for each deadline), and give them a realistic estimate of what I can do within the next week/two weeks for the given project
- As much as possible (when I'm able to) I'll work on only one (and sometimes two) project for the entire day. This reduces the switching cost

### Presenting a project to nontechnical audience
- If doing for the first time, have a conversation with any coworkers who may have presented to same audience 
- "Know your audience"
- Initially get my thoughts down the way I think of them ("word vomit"). After doing that, consider salient important points. 
- If presenting to a mixed audience, keep the technical detail about the same, but have prepared appendix slides of the more technical details, in case questions are asked.

### Supervising a co-op
- Partially responsible for training a Co-op on a project I'm working on. Goal is to train them
- My goal is to

### Data pulling
- In my current role, was tasked with calculating MSR of all potency panels. However,
